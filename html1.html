			<h3>Survivor Stories</h3>
				<p>Seeing the parade of motorcycles from all over the United States was super exciting.
				They brought pins and patches from all over the United States and put them on a sash to decorate my wheelchair. 
				After so many days of pain and boredom, seeing the Cycle Out Cancer riders was a real thrill!  ~ Jennifer</p>
				<p>I spent 10 days in the hospital just crying.  The Cycle Out Cancer guys were so colorful
				and generous.  They gave the hospital a very generous donation in my name and showed me
				that even strangers care about me. ~ Kristen</p>
				<p>I had the good fortune to meet several Cycle Out Cancer guys. Everyone has been touched 
				by cancer.  They are out there doing something about it. ~ Fritz</p>
				<p>As soon as my treatments are over, I'm getting a Spyder motorcycle to ride with Cycle Out Cancer.
				Can't wait! ~ Scott</p>
